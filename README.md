# Overview of the school district analysis:
Academic dishonesty was suspected to be occurring at Thomas High School for ninth grade math and reading scores. They have asked for the scores to be removed while keeping the rest of the data intact. This is an analysis that cleans up the student's names, removes the data, and generates a report on the results.
